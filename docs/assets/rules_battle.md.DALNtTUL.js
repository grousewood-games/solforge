The field has five lanes with spaces for each player. Creatures always battle an opposing creature in the same lane, or deal their battle damage to the opposing player if there is no creature opposite them. There can be at most one creature in each lane.</p><p>When you play a creature, it will be sleeping, indicated by the solforge ring over the card. Sleeping creatures cannot attack, use <code>Activate</code> abilities or change lanes with <code>Mobility</code>. However they will fight back if another creature engages them in battle.</p><p>During the battle, opposing creatures will deal damage to each other based on their attack values as long as at least one of the creatures is on the offensive. Two non-offensive creatures in the same lane will not fight. Creatures are destroyed when their health is at or below zero.</p><p>If an attacking creature is unopposed, it will deal its damage on the opposing player. Damage is unleashed left-to-right from the active player&#39;s perspective. This can have importance when considering player Armor and cards that react to player damage, like <code>Oratek Explosives</code>.</p><p>A battle happens every turn.</p>',7),s=[i];function n(l,c,h,p,d,u){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const g=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
