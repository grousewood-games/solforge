These are notated by blue card symbols on the right side of the screen. On the very first turn, the player can only play one card. Some cards will grant additional plays. Other cards may grant free plays of a specific type of card (notated by green card symbols). Some cards are labelled <code>Free</code> and can be played willy-nilly.</p><p>Creature cards <code>Forge</code> a creature to one of your lanes on the board. Spell cards will present specific targets for their effects. The cards you play will get <a href="./card-leveling.html">leveled up</a> into your discard pile.</p><p>There is also a <a href="./battle.html">battle phase</a> during each turn, where every eligible creature (friendly and enemy) will attack. If two creatures are head-to-head in a lane, they will fight each other. Unapposed creatures will damage the opposing player.</p><p>At the end of the turn, the remaining cards in your hand get discarded (without being leveled). You then draw five new cards.</p><p>The opposing player will then take their turn.</p><p>At the end of every fourth turn, a <code>Rank Up</code> happens. Your discard pile is put back into your deck and is reshuffled, allowing you to draw your leveled up cards.</p><p>The primary goal of the game is to reduce your opponent&#39;s health to 0 (or below) by dealing damage with your creatures and spells. The secondary goal is to have a good time.</p>',10),n=[l];function i(d,s,c,h,p,u){return r(),a("div",null,n)}const m=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
