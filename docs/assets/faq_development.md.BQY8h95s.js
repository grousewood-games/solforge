It released in 2013 and shut down in 2018.</p><h2 id="does-this-earn-money" tabindex="-1">Does This Earn Money? <a class="header-anchor" href="#does-this-earn-money" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Does This Earn Money?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>No. A strict condition of Stoneblade Entertainment allowing something like this is that it remains free in its entirety. If you would like to make a monetary contribution, my suggestion is to check out <a href="https://solforgefusion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Solforge Fusion</a>. It is the spiritual successor to Solforge, and any treats purchased will directly benefit the people who designed the original game, procured the artwork, etc.</p><h2 id="make-it-open-source" tabindex="-1">Make It Open Source? <a class="header-anchor" href="#make-it-open-source" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Make It Open Source?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Perhaps when I am &quot;finished&quot;. Right now only the minified build will be public, as I would like to continue working without someone else forking it and trying to one-up the project.</p><h2 id="online-play" tabindex="-1">Online Play? <a class="header-anchor" href="#online-play" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Online Play?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Unlikely. Originally I focused on single player as I did not have permission to make this public (July 2022). When it was revealed that this type of thing would be allowed (April 2023), it became an option. I had some hesitation due to the effort level and the likely scenario that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SolForge/comments/tiv839/what_would_it_take_to_get_you_to_play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nobody would play it for long</a>. Shortly after (May 2023), Kaelari announced he was resurrecting his own effort, now named <a href="./../kaelforge.html">KaelForge</a>. He is the people&#39;s champion of Solforge (a title well earned through colossal efforts over years; I enjoyed many a tourny on <code>solforgeladder.com</code>), and his server kung-fu is better than mine. Competing with him seems a questionable time investment; there are a number of other projects I&#39;m itching to get to.</p><h2 id="keyboard-support" tabindex="-1">Keyboard Support? <a class="header-anchor" href="#keyboard-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Keyboard Support?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The site currently doesn&#39;t support it.

Clickity-clicks will have to do.</p><h2 id="better-deckbuilder" tabindex="-1">Better Deckbuilder? <a class="header-anchor" href="#better-deckbuilder" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Better Deckbuilder?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The current deckbuilder page was slapped together so people could brew a deck. Making a proper builder with filters and such is going to take a minute. I have something half-written, and my ability to work on this has diminished.</p><h2 id="request-a-new-feature" tabindex="-1">Request A New Feature? <a class="header-anchor" href="#request-a-new-feature" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Request A New Feature?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You can.
