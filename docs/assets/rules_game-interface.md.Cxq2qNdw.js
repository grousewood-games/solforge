In theory this should provide the greatest challenge. Gameplay may feel repetitive as it will tend to favour the same picks.</li><li><code>Savant</code> will select from the upper-tier choices. Moves will generally be sensible, with some variety mixed in.</li><li><code>Wurm</code> is more &quot;open to experiences&quot; in making selections. It will still make reasonable picks, but can open up plays with less-popular cards.</li></ul></li><li><code>Bot Priorities</code> will adjust how the AI calculates the value of each action. Higher levels will give that metric more priority. Adjusting these settings for a specific deck strategy can help the bot put up a better fight. <ul><li><code>Minions</code> will prefer having a creature present in a lane, regardless of its quality.</li><li><code>Potency</code> will favour creatures of higher quality. This includes health, attack, effects like armor and regenerate, and the ability to impact itself or other creatures.</li><li><code>Menace</code> will value a creature&#39;s potential to inflict damage. Primarily attack and breakthrough.</li><li><code>Life Gain</code> will focus on increasing the player&#39;s life and defending against player damage.</li><li><code>Life Drain</code> will relish in reducing the opponent player&#39;s life total.</li><li><code>Deck</code> will respect improving the quality of cards in your deck for better future draws.</li><li><code>Hand</code> will attempt to draw more cards into the players hand.</li><li>Minions, Potency, and Menace are symmetrical measures. For example, a high Minions setting will also result in the bot wanting to reduce your creature count as well as increase its own.</li></ul></li><li><code>Random Filter</code> allows you to limit the qualifying decks selected in Random mode. This only appears when setting up a Constructed game. <ul><li><code>Good</code> categories are competitive decks who&#39;s dominant cards are from the sets listed. In general, later sets have more powerful cards.</li><li><code>Average</code> decks are functional but are often at a disadvantage against Good decks.</li><li><code>Jank</code> decks typically work on a gimmick or theme. Full of fun times but typically can&#39;t keep pace with stronger decks. Note that Infinity decks are in this category; once Energy Surge got Overload on L3, they are no longer infinite.</li><li><code>Official</code> decks were from the original app and used to showcase new cards. They are cohesive but not top-tier.</li></ul></li><li><code>Reset All</code> will appear if changes have been made. Clicking it will set everything back to the Mimicwurm default settings.</li></ul>',47),u=[h];function p(g,f,m,w,y,b){return a(),t("div",null,u)}const T=e(d,[["render",p]]);export{k as __pageData,T as default};
