## Current Release

### (Forge Guardian) Beta `v0.4.0`

- All cards in Sets 1, 2 & 3 freely available.
- Constructed and Draft modes.
- Battle vs the AI (artificial unintelligence is more accurate).
- Fun bonus modes.
- Unfriendly deckbuilder.
- Best played on a desktop monitor with standard resolution (1080p non-retina) and a pointer device.
- Tablet / retina _works_ but has some issues at the moment.
  - Tablet screen dimensions can be a poor fit for the layout.
  - Feel free to log issues with your bad experiences; I'm limited with what devices I can test on.

## Legal Stuff

I've looked at the various licenses on github but I don't read lawyer well. My code is open, do with it as you please. That said, as outlined in the [credits](docs/faq.md#credits), a good portion of this is the intellectual property of others. Trying to take anything from this repo and monetize it in any form is highly inadvisable. You might get a lunch date with a cease & desist.
