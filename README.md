## Current Release

### (Forge Guardian) Beta `v0.1.0`

- All cards in Sets 1 & 2 freely available.
- Constructed and Draft modes.
- Battle vs the AI (artificial unintelligence is more accurate).
- Fun bonus modes.
- Unfriendly deckbuilder.
- Best played on a desktop monitor with standard resolution (1080p non-retina) and a pointer device.
- Tablet / retina _works_ but has significant issues at the moment.
  - Fonts in the game field can be blurry.
  - Tablet screen dimensions can be a poor fit for the layout.
  - Loading and saving constructed deck files is highly suspect.

## Legal Stuff

I've looked at the various licenses on github but I don't read lawyer well. My code is open, do with it as you please. That said, as outlined in the [credits](docs/faq.md#credits), a good portion of this is the intellectual property of others. I highly advise not trying to take anything from this repo and monetize it in any form. You might get a lunch date with a cease & desist.

Use your noggin :brain:. Show respect :trophy:.
